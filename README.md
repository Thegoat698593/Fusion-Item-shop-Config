1) Before you start making your custom shop make sure you read everything carefully so you don't have any troubles.
   
2) This is what the shop will look like if you did everything correctly!

3) understanding how it works | This is how it should look like all you have to do is copy this & then head to https://fortnite.gg/ and select a cosmetic you want and put it in there i know it's confusing but let me show you!

4) Ok so where it says Athenacharacter those are skins, AthenaGlider is of course a glider so you get it | make sure you put the ID in the brackets so like this   "AthenaPickaxe:Pickaxe_ID_202_AshtonBoardwalk"

5) Also really important! | YOU CANNOT CHOOSE A COSMETIC FROM SEASONS BEYOND SEASON 8 BECAUSE IT WILL NOT WORK AS THOSE COSMETCIS AREN'T IN S8 SO CHOOSE ONE FROM S1-S8 AND YOU WILL BE GOOD
